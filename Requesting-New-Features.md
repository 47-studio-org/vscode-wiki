## Step 1 - Is your feature an existing feature? 

Before requesting a new feature, check to see if someone else has already requested it. 

* [Query](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Afeature-request%20sort%3Areactions-1-desc%20) for the most popular issues.
* Run a text based search over all [issues](). 
* Search by [label category](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/labels). 

If you find an existing issue, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). 

If not, proceed to step 2. 

## Step 2 - Create a feature request. 

1. Click the green `New Issue` button on the [issues tab](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).  
2. Enter as many details as possible, including animations and screenshots if applicable. 
3. Label the issue a `feature request`.
3. A team member will be assigned the issue. Respond to their queries as we seek to clarify the requested feature. 

## Step 3 - Find others to support your feature request. 

As you do, we have limited time and cannot build every single feature. Features with more support will naturally be prioritized higher on our list. So recruit your Github friends and other colleagues to add their reactions to your requested feature! 

## Step 4 - Watch our Iteration Plans.

We plan each iteration with an issue in Github. You can see all the issues we are working on for the [current iteration](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/labels/iteration-plan). We would appreciate your feedback in the planning and development process.
