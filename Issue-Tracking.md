This page describes how we track issues in the `vscode` repository.

# Inbox tracking

The inbox are bugs which have no assigned owner and no assigned label. Assigning an owner or a label like `feature-request`, `question`, `more info needed` indicates that the issue has been triaged.

[Inbox query](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+no%3Alabel)

# Bug verification

Bugs should be verified. 
- Once a bug is fixed its state is changed to `closed`. 
- If it needs verification it is assigned to another team member
- Once verified the issue is labeled with `verified`

Create a personal query: current milestone, assigned to me, closed, `-label:"verified âœ“"`

# Duplicates

Duplicate bugs are closed with a comment `duplicates bug #issue`

# Issue Triage

Issues are assigned a label that indicates the issue type:
- `bug`: incorrect behaviour of the code
- `feature-request`: a request for an enhancement
- `question`: a question from a user

Issues can be assigned to a feature area using a label. The feature area labels are 'greenish'.

# Moving issues to another repository

Use [issue mover](https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/) tool to move bugs to another repository.

**Notice** labels are copied to another repository, therefore when moving an issue to a repository owned by another team we should remove our custom labels.
