# The Planning Process
Milestones are roughly month based rather than week based. We will begin a milestone on a Monday and end on a Friday, meaning that each milestone can have a different duration, depending on how the weeks align.

Towards the end of of each milestone we will hold a planning meeting where we prioritize features to implement and bugs to fix in the upcoming milestone. The result of this meeting will be a set of features on the [[Roadmap]] along with a set of bugs marked to be fixed in the upcoming Milestone. Together, this encompasses the planned work for the upcoming month.

Each feature will have design or description of the feature that can be contributed by, augmented, and commented upon by the community. 

#  The Triage Process
Like all software projects, we will plan to do more than we can actually get done during a milestone. This is OK, it is better to be aggressive aspire for greatness rather than being passive and settling for "good enough".

Bugs and features will be assigned a milestone and within a milestone they will be assigned a priority. The priority dictates the order in which work items should be addressed. A P1 bug (something that we think is critical for the milestone) is to be addressed before a P2 bug. 

# Weekly Planning
Each week we will review our progress and reasses progress and the schedule, crossing off completed features and triaging bugs. At the end of the milestone we will strive for 0 bugs and 0 issues in the milestone, indicating we are done. This means that bugs and features will be postponed to later milestones.

# End Game
The final week of the milestone is what we call the "end game". During this week we will wrap up any feature work, we will test, and then we will fix the critical bugs for that milestone.

At the end of this process we will produce a build and release it on the `insiders` update stream. We will monitor incoming issues from this release, fix any critical bugs that arise, and then produce a final release for the milestone.
