There are three great ways to contribute to the VS Code project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests, and creating suggestions.

## Logging Bugs
To log a bug, just use the GitHub issue tracker. Confirmed bugs will be labelled with the `Bug` label. Please include code to reproduce the issue and a description of what you expected to happen.

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!

## Pull Requests

Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). See the "Legal" section of the [CONTRIBUTING.md guide in the repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). That document also outlines the technical nuts and bolts of submitting a pull request. Be sure to follow our [[Coding Guidelines|Coding-Guidelines]].

## Suggestions

We're also interested in your feedback in future of Code. You can submit a suggestion or feature request through the issue tracker. To make this process more effective, we're asking that these include more information to help define them more clearly. Start by reading the [[Design Goals]].

## Discussion Etiquette

In order to keep the conversation clear and transparent, please limit discussion to English and keep things on topic with the issue. Be considerate to others and try to be courteous and professional at all times.
