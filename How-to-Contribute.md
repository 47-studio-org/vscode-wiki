There are three great ways to contribute to the VS Code project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests, and creating suggestions.

## Logging Bugs
To log a bug, just use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues). 
Confirmed bugs will be labelled with the `Bug` label. Please do a search to see if the issue has been reported already and if not, all of the following are helpful so we can better reproduce the problem.
* Code that demonstrates the issue
* Verison of Code
* Description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Errors in the Dev Tools (Help | Toggle Developer Tools)

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!

## Pull Requests
Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a [[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)|Contributor-License-Agreement]]. It is an automated process and you only need to do it once. The project [README.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/README.md) details how to clone, build, run, debug and test Code. Be sure to follow our [[Coding Guidelines|Coding-Guidelines]].

## Suggestions
We're also interested in your feedback in future of Code. You can submit a suggestion or feature request through the issue tracker. To make this process more effective, we're asking that these include more information to help define them more clearly. 

## Discussion Etiquette

In order to keep the conversation clear and transparent, please limit discussion to English and keep things on topic with the issue. Be considerate to others and try to be courteous and professional at all times.
