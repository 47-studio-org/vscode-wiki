The Alpha build is designed for early adopters wanting a nightly release. Alpha build is the build we use internally to develop the current release. The latest bug fixes, features, etc. are all in the Alpha build. Over the course of an iteration the Alpha build may change constantly. 

The release notes are contained in the following queries. 

## [recently closed commits](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
