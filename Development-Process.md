# Development Process

## Roadmap
The team has a 6 month high level road-map <<<link>>>. The road maps defines high level themes and features.

## Iterations
We then work in monthly iterations on the items on the road map. The iterations align with the calendar months. At the end of each iteration we want to have a version of Code that can be used by Code community. The work planned during an iteration is captured in the iteration plan. The feature highlights of each iteration are highlighted in the release notes.

## Inside an Iteration
We work in weekly segments:
- 1st week - reduce debt introduced in the previous iteration, address critical issues uncovered in the previous iteration, plan the next iteration
- 2nd week - work according the plan
- 3rd week - work according the plan
- 4th week - iteration end game, the teams tests the new features according a test plan, fixes bugs, and updates the documentation
